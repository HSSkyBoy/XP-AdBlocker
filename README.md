# Adblocker Reborn v2 (XP-AdBlocker)
#### Created by @aviraxp

This is the recontinued reborn version of a deprecated Xposed module AdBlocker, relying on Xposed Framework to work.
Why you should use it? Because it's not VPN or Hosts based! You can use any VPN you want while using this Xposed Module for blocking all the ads in background. And also, you can choose which apps you want to block, and their ad services and recievers. Deprecated but Handy, isn't it? :)

## Development

The original developer @aviraxp has abandoned this project since Nougat was coming. Then, @zsakvo continued it a bit, and left.

## Distribution
